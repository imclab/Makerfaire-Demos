The animated gif station lets you do stop motion animation with animated gif,
but to work properly it requires:

* an arduino running firmata and pyfirmata https://bitbucket.org/tino/pyfirmata/src
* a brother label printer on a server running pyrinter https://github.com/xamox/pyrinter
* a working flickr account
* gif writing library from http://www.doxdesk.com/file/software/py/v/gifWriter-0.2.py
